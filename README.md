## 💡 Inspiration

### 🤓 Why Sho ify (not Shopify)

**Sho ify is a deliberate abstraction.**

We dropped the “p” from Shopify to represent removing the page-based, physical plane of traditional e-commerce. “Sho” reflects shopping in spatial reality, where products exist around you in 3D, not on a flat screen.

- **Shopify →** shopping on a 2D page  
- **Sho ify →** shopping in 3D space  

The missing “p” stands for **pages, pointers, and physical constraints**—all eliminated in VR.

We wanted to showcase the power of the **Shopify Storefront API** by transforming e-commerce into an immersive experience. Traditional online shopping lacks the tactile, engaging feel of a physical store—we bridge that gap and increase shopping accessibility and excitement with VR. 🎮

## ✨ What it does

Sho ify brings **any Shopify store into VR**:

- 🏪 **VR Shopping Room** – Immersive 3D environment with realistic lighting  
- 📦 **Live Product Data** – Real-time products from Shopify Storefront API  
- 🤖 **AI Assistant “Shoppy”** – Wandering mascot with OpenAI TTS voice  
- 🎯 **Interactive Products** – Pick up, examine, and add to cart in VR  
- 🛒 **One Click Checkout** – Sent to your phone via Twilio SMS integration  
- 🥽 **Meta Quest 3** – Fully optimized with hand tracking

## 🛠️ How we built it

### Phase 1: Shopify Storefront API Integration 🔌

We leveraged **Shopify Storefront GraphQL API** to build a REST wrapper that fetches:

- Product search and details  
- Product media (images, videos, etc.)  
- Shop information and brand logos  
- Variants, pricing, and inventory  

**Key Storefront API Features Used:**

- `products` query for search and filtering  
- `product` query for detailed product info  
- `media` query for 3D models and rich media  
- `shop` query for store branding and settings  

**Tech:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript wrapping Shopify's GraphQL API

---

### Phase 2: AI-Generated 3D Product Creation 🧠🧊

Leveraged **HuggingFace Hunyuan3D-2.1**, a two-stage diffusion-transformer system that:

- Generates high-quality 3D geometry first  
- Applies photorealistic textures in a second pass  
- Produces complete 3D assets one-shot from a single product image  

The model was hosted on a GPU instance via **Gradio**, enabling fast, scalable generation. Using product images and metadata, we automatically created beautiful, ready-to-use 3D product models for seamless import into the VR shop environment.

---

### Phase 3: Unity VR Environment 🎮

Built a modular VR shop system:

- Procedural room generation  
- Dynamic Shopify brand logo loading  
- Product display with Storefront API data  
- Optimized for 72fps VR performance  

**Tech:** Unity 3D + Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

---

### Phase 4: AI Shopping Assistant 🤖

Created **“Shoppy”** using:

- OpenAI TTS API for natural voice  
- AI pathfinding for natural movement  
- Speech bubbles with synchronized audio  

---

### Phase 5: Meta Quest 3 Integration 🥽

- Oculus XR Plugin for headset tracking  
- Meta Quest Simulator for debugging  
- XR Interaction Toolkit for controllers  
- Hand tracking support  

---

### Phase 6: One-Click Checkout & SMS Magic Link 🛒📲

Enabled frictionless purchasing with:

- One-click checkout directly from VR  
- Twilio SMS integration to send a secure magic link  
- Pre-filled checkout with items already in the basket  
- Mobile-optimized checkout flow for instant conversion

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

### VR Performance ⚡  
Maintaining 72fps with dynamic lighting  

**Solution:** Disabled light probes, cached materials, optimized rendering  

### Shopify Storefront API Structure 📊  
GraphQL format needed transformation  

**Solution:** Built REST wrapper with type-safe TypeScript interfaces, matching Shop Minis SDK patterns  

### Flickering During Movement 💫  
Shoppy flickered when moving  

**Solution:** Force-disabled light probes in `LateUpdate()`, used physics-based movement  

### 3D Model Loading 📦  
Loading GLB/USDZ from Storefront API  

**Solution:** Implemented media endpoint that fetches `Model3d` types from Shopify  

### Meta Quest Simulator Setup 🔧  
Debugging without constant headset connection  

**Solution:** Configured Quest Simulator for rapid iteration
