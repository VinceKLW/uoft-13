Unity Project

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `TTS` folder in Unity Hub
3. Unity will automatically import and set up the project

## Project Structure

- `TTS/Assets/` - All game assets (scripts, scenes, prefabs, materials, etc.)
- `TTS/ProjectSettings/` - Unity project settings (committed for consistency)
- `TTS/Packages/` - Package manager configuration

## Important Notes

- The `.gitignore` file ensures that generated files (Library/, Temp/, Logs/, etc.) are not committed
- Only commit source assets and project settings
- When cloning, Unity will regenerate the Library/ and Temp/ folders automatically
